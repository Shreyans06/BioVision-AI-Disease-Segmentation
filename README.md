### BioVision: AI Disease Segmentation

This project focuses on the semantic segmentation of diseases from chest X-rays using the ChestX-Det dataset. The goal is to accurately localize diseases within the lungs for improved diagnosis and treatment planning

### Features
- U-Net & U-Net++ Models: Used for high-performance semantic segmentation
- Dataset: The ChestX-Det dataset was converted to COCO format with augmented images
- Performance: Achieved mean IoU of 0.88 for U-Net and 0.86 for U-Net++
